This helper file provides simple wrapper around tensorboard for gathering
statistics as a research tool to get insight into differential privacy and
to observe how clipping, and noising affects loss, accuracy, ...
Internal Privacy metrics (`StatType.PRIVACY` and StatType.CLIPPING` are
already added to the code and need only be activated by adding the stat
as shown in the example. Other stat types need to be added to the stat
and updated properly using `update` function. Example below tries to
show simple use cases.

Example:
    If an instance of `tensorboard.SummaryWriter` exists it can be used
    for stat gathering, o.w. one can be created, e.g.

        stats.set_global_summary_writer(tensorboard.SummaryWriter())

    If you like to get stats about clipping you can add the following line
    to your main file. That is it. The frequency, defines the sampling frequency
    of the statistics. By default the samples are averaged and the average is
    reported every `1 / frequency` times.

        stats.add(
            stats.Stat(stats.StatType.CLIPPING, 'AllLayers', frequency=0.1))

    To add stats about test accuracy you can do:

        stats.add(stats.StatType.TEST, 'accuracy', frequency=0.1))

    and then update the stat in the proper location using:

        # calculate accuracy@1 for example
        stats.update(stats.StatType.TEST, acc1=acc1_value)
